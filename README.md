# Electric-Meters-Consumption-Analysis

Recently, I completed a project involving electric meters where I categorised the meters along with their IDs into 5 categories which are Domestic with Solar, Normal Domestic, Domestic with High Compliance, Corporate and Industrial and performed exploratory analysis on the Tableau software. I took into account the energy consumption, voltage, current and many other factors of the categorised meters and compared them within their types so that insightful data can be obtained out of this 3 years data. So here, I kept a specific threshold value and if the particular parameter of the meter crosses this value, then it will be reported to the electrical company for further speculation and reparation of it. Also I have plotted a moving average graph for the energy consumption of the meters so that its values can be compared over a 7-day or 30-day period cycle. Also I have created two separate dashboards for both laptop and mobile users to provide better accessibility to the viewers.
